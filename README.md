Just some quick plan notes for now:

- No GC
- Compiles fast
- Static typing with templates/generics
- Explicit copy, move, and borrow semantics
- Probably no full memory/type safety
- Convenient exceptions, perhaps still as return types
- More data-oriented than object-oriented
- Still has classes
- Operator overloading
- Tensors (ND arrays)
