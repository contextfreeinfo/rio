# Rio

A programming language someday maybe.

Try this for now:

```sh
cargo run -- run examples/hi.rio
```

Or for more fun, which cargo installs wasm-tools and wasmi_cli:

```sh
python run.py
```

Or maybe soon just this? It abusively builds rio separately and runs it.

```sh
cargo test -- --nocapture
```
