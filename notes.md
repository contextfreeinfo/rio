- Top level source files works. Auto include of `src` dirs, too.
- Prohibit libstdc++ in compiler for faster compile.
- Compile to subset safe for c99 (so tcc works) and c++ (for c++ interop).
- Cast like `expr: type`.
- All private until explicit private section?
- Parse `fun name` syntax for reporting specific error?
- Use `name fun` as shorthand for `name => fun`?
- Use `&type..0` as null-terminated and `&type..*` for raw.
- Allow `&type..+` as safe deref with hint of more or just stick to `&type`?
- Default string literals to `[u8..0]` (or `[u8, 0]`?) as null-terminated slice.
- Also allow string literals as `&u8..0`, `[u8]`, `u8` (if 1 u8), or other ints.
- Still keep `string` keyword as equivalent to `[u8..0]` (or `[u8, 0]`?)?
- Range types as `u8..` with pointer as `&(u8..)` and slice `[u8..]`.
- Separate `fun` from `proc`? Does it matter with default const? Side effects???
- Change unqualified `use package` to external packages, not siblings
- Treat all name conflicts as errors, or let local package override others?
- Definitely conflicts between externals count as errors
- Use/run a dir gets all in dir, use/run a file gets just that file
- For data files (always [u8])?: data = include "..."

```
# Just use all non-conflicting from c.
use 'c'

# Use c as a wrapper around the imported items.
c => use 'c'

# Use c as a wrapper and import non-conflicting.
c => use 'c' as *

# Use c as wrapper, import non-conflicting, and use explicit aliases.
c => use 'c' as

# Maybe `as` also for destructuring locals?

  # No `*` for locals.
  # Same name.
  something
  # Local var `other` from `that` in the return struct.
