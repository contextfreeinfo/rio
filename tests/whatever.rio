# This file is just for exploring thoughts.
# Nothing here compiles right now.

# Probably have classes with default private for encapsulating behavior?
# As opposed to structs for data modeling only and everything public?
Something pub class

  # Up to one constructor for literal expressions (e.g., `(that)`)?
  # Alternatively just require external functions to construct.
  new pub fun(data: That)
    # Return by expression, with shorthand field init.
    {data}
  end

  # Method
  act pub proc(this)
    this.data->apply
    loop = while true
      break loop => 'great'
    end
  end

  data: That

  # Pointer to function with default assignment
  apply = fun(data: That)
    # Do something
  end

end Something
